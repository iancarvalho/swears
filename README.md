Originally written as a 'screen' library for Uni*/Linux/DOS that works similar to
the curses library but stripped down to be lightweight.  It was developed mainly to
support terminal operations over slow dial up links.
This version of the library has been further modified to support microcontrollers
without the need for an operating system.
